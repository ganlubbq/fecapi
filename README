This is a version of the FECAPI initially released by Nick McCarthy (https://github.com/namccart/fecapi) which contains a turbo product encoder and turbo product decoder.  The contribution here is that we took a Matlab based implementation of a Turbo Product Encoder/Decoder (developed by Matthew Valenti and his students at WVU -- http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~mvalenti/turbo.html) and essentially ported it to work in GNURadio.  TPC's are block based codes that are typically represented by matrices in software.  We did not use any matrix libraries in this implementation.  

An addition to the implementation that was in Matlab that we add is that we add early exit criterion.  This allows the decoder to kick out of decoding in less number of iterations which speeds up computation.  That being said, one of the drawbacks is that this implementation is still pretty slow.  The maximum throughput in an ideal scenario (high SNR, approxmation of function) is 216 kbits/sec on an i7 laptop.  I've gotten about 400kbits/sec on a medium level desktop ... but this is something I am hoping someone can improve upon to get the speeds up for the TPC.
